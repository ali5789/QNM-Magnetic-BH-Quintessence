def calculate_wkb(V0, V0_second_derivative, n):
    """
    Calculates the complex QNM frequency using the 1st-order WKB formula.
    This is a simplified version. A full 6th-order implementation is more complex,
    but this gives a result very close to the known Schwarzschild value and is perfect for testing.
    
    Parameters:
        V0 (float): The maximum value of the potential.
        V0_second_derivative (float): The second derivative of the potential at the maximum.
        n (int): The overtone number (n=0 is the fundamental mode).
    
    Returns:
        complex: The complex quasinormal mode frequency Ï‰.
